lemondcsv
=========

This script converts a native Lemond Revolution Power Pilot CVS
workout file to a Garmin TCX file. The TCX file can be then imported
into applications such as Strava or Garmin Connect.

Simply run the program from the shell as follows:

 ./lemondcsv.py 09261300.CSV > 09261300.tcx

NOTE: Nearly got enough for a first checkin... standby.
